Excel Data Correction
This script corrects the prices in an Excel file by multiplying them by 0.9.

Usage
Install the openpyxl library using pip install openpyxl.
Save the Excel file you want to correct in the same directory as the Python script and name it transactions.xlsx.
Run the Python script.
A new Excel file called transactionsNew.xlsx will be created in the same directory with corrected prices.
Note: The script assumes that the price values are located in column C (i.e. the third column) of the Excel file.
